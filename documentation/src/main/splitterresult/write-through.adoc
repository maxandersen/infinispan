_Write-through_ is a cache store update mode. When this mode is used, clients
update a cache entry, e.g. via a +Cache.put()+ invocation, the call will not
return until {brandname} has updated the underlying cache store. Normally this
means that updates to the cache store are done in the client thread.

An alternative mode in which cache stores can be updated is _write-behind_.
