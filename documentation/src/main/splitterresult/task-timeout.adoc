:context: task-timeout

It is possible to set a timeout value for the operation requests. This timeout is used only for remote requests timing out and
it is on a per request basis. The former means the local execution will not timeout and the latter means if you have a failover
scenario as described above the subsequent requests each have a new timeout.  If no timeout is specified it uses the
replication timeout as a default timeout. You can set the timeout in your task by doing the following:

[source,java]
----
CacheStream<Object, String> stream = cache.entrySet().stream();
stream.timeout(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
----

For more information about this, please check the java doc in
