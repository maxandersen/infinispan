The following topology hints can be specified:

Machine:: This is probably the most useful, when multiple JVM instances run on the
same node, or even when multiple virtual machines run on the same physical machine.
Rack:: In larger clusters, nodes located on the same rack are more likely to experience a
hardware or network failure at the same time.
Site:: Some clusters may have nodes in multiple physical locations for extra resilience.
Note that Cross site replication is another alternative for
clusters that need to span two or more data centres.

All of the above are optional.
When provided, the distribution algorithm will try to spread the ownership of each
segment across as many sites, racks, and machines (in this order) as possible.
