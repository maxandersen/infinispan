Hibernate offers a configuration option `hibernate.cache.use_minimal_puts` which is off by default in {brandname} implementation. This option checks if the cache contains given key before updating the value from database (put-from-load) and omits the update if the cached value is already present.
When using invalidation caches it makes sense to keep this off as the put-from-load is local node-only and silently fails if the entry is locked. With replicated/distributed caches the update is applied to remote nodes, even if the local node already contains the entry, and this has higher performance impact, so it might make sense to turn this option on and avoid updating the cache.
