= Overriding programmatically
:context: overriding-programmatically

Is is possible to override programmatically the encoding used for both keys and values, by calling the _.withEncoding()_ method variants from _AdvancedCache_.

Example, consider the following cache configured as OFF_HEAP:

[source,java]
----
link:code_examples/EncoderOverride.java[]
----

The override can be useful if any operation in the cache does not require decoding, such as counting number of entries,
or calculating the size of byte[] of an OFF_HEAP cache.
