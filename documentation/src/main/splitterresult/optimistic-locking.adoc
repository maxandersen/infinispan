Optimistic locking is a concurrency control method that assumes that multiple
transactions can complete without affecting each other, and that therefore
transactions can proceed without locking the data resources that they affect.
Before committing, each transaction verifies that no other transaction has
modified its data. If the check reveals conflicting modifications, the
committing transaction rolls back.
