According to link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID[Wikipedia], ACID (Atomicity,
Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee
that database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases,
 a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a
 transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple
changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single
transaction.
