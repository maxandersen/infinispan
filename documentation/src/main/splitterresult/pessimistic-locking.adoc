:context: pessimistic-locking

A lock is used when multiple threads need to access data concurrently. This
prevents data from being corrupted or invalidated when multiple threads try to
modify the same item of data. Any single thread can only modify data to which
it has applied a lock that gives them exclusive access to the record until the
lock is released.  However, pessimistic locking isn't ideal from a throughput
perspective, as locking is expensive and serializing writes may not be desired.
_Optimistic locking_ is often seen as a preferred alternative in many cases.
