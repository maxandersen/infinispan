So how does this all come together?  Invocations on the cache cause the cache
to first create an invocation context for the call.  Invocation contexts
contain, among other things, transactional characteristics of the call.  The
cache then creates a command for the call, making use of a command factory which
initialises the command instance with parameters and references to other subsystems.

The cache then passes the invocation context and command to the InterceptorChain,
which calls each and every registered interceptor in turn to visit the command,
adding behaviour to the call.  Finally, the commandâ€™s perform() method is invoked
and the return value, if any, is propagated back to the caller.
