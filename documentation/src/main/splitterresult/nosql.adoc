A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that
employs less constrained consistency models than traditional relational
databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design,
horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. NoSQL databases are
often highly optimized keyâ€“value stores intended for simple retrieval and
appending operations, with the goal being significant performance benefits in
terms of latency and throughput. NoSQL databases are finding significant and
growing industry use in big data and real-time web applications.
