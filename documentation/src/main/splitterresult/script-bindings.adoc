= Script bindings
:context: script-bindings

The script engine within {brandname} exposes several internal objects as bindings in the scope of the script execution.
These are:

* cache: the cache against which the script is being executed
* marshaller: the marshaller to use for marshalling/unmarshalling data to the cache
* cacheManager: the cacheManager for the cache
* scriptingManager: the instance of the script manager which is being used to run the script. This can be used to run other scripts from a script.
