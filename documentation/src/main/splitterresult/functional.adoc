:context: functional

The functional map offers a listener API, where clients can register for and
get notified when events take place. These notifications are post-event, so
that means the events are received after the event has happened.

The listeners that can be registered are split into two categories:
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.WriteListeners.html[write listeners]
and
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.html[read-write listeners].
