.Infinispan versions
[WARNING,textlabel="Warning",name="warning"]
====
This version of the protocol was implemented since Infinispan 4.1.0.Final and is no longer supported since
Infinispan 10.
====

[IMPORTANT,textlabel="Important",name="important"]
====
All key and values are sent and stored as byte arrays. Hot Rod
makes no assumptions about their types.
====

Some clarifications about the other types:

* vInt : Variable-length integers are defined defined as compressed,
positive integers  where the high-order bit of each byte indicates whether
more bytes need to be  read. The low-order seven bits are appended as
increasingly more significant bits in the resulting integer value making it
efficient to decode. Hence, values from zero to 127 are  stored in a single
byte, values from 128 to 16,383 are stored in two bytes, and so on:

* signed vInt: The vInt above is also able to encode negative values, but will
always use the maximum size (5 bytes) no matter how small the endoded value is.
In order to have a small payload for negative values too, signed vInts uses ZigZag
encoding on top of the vInt encoding.
More details link:http://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#types[here]
* vLong : Refers to unsigned variable length long values similar to vInt but
applied to longer values. They're between 1 and 9 bytes long.
* String : Strings are always represented using UTF-8 encoding.
