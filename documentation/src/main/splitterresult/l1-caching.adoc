When L1 is enabled, a node will keep the result of remote reads locally for a short
period of time (configurable, 10 minutes by default), and repeated lookups will return
the local L1 value instead of asking the owners again.

L1 caching is not free though.
Enabling it comes at a cost, and this cost is that every entry update must broadcast an
invalidation message to all the nodes.
L1 entries can be evicted just like any other entry when the the cache is configured
with a maximum size.
Enabling L1 will improve performance for repeated reads of non-local keys, but it will
slow down writes and it will increase memory consumption to some degree.

Is L1 caching right for you?
The correct approach is to benchmark your application with and without L1 enabled and see
what works best for your access pattern.
