= Zero Capacity Node
:context: zero-capacity-node

You might need to configure a whole node where the capacity factor is `0` for every cache,
user defined caches and internal caches.
When defining a zero capacity node, the node won't hold any data.
This is how you declare a zero capacity node:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+",nowrap-option=""]
----
link:config_examples/zero_capacity_node.xml[]
----

[source,java]
----
link:code_examples/ZeroCapacityNode.java[]
----

However, note that this will be true for distributed caches only. If you are using replicated
caches, the node will still keep a copy of the value. Use only distributed caches to make the
best use of this feature.
