= Roles
:context: roles

The project assumes one of 2 _roles_ an individual may assume when interacting with the {brandname} codebase. The 2 roles here are:

.Roles
* _Contributor_
* _Project Admin_ (typically, no more than a small handful of people)

[NOTE,textlabel="Note",name="note"]
====
None of the roles assume that you are a Red Hat employee.
All it assumes is how much responsibility over the project has been granted to you.
Typically, someone may be in more than one role at any given time, and puts on a different "hats" based on the task at hand.
