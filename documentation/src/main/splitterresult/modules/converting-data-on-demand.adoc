= Converting Data On Demand

If the cache is configured to store data in a binary format such as `application/x-protostream` or `application/x-jboss-marshalling`, you can configure your deployed code to perform cache operations using Java objects as the media type. See link:#mediatype_override[Overriding the MediaType Programmatically].

This approach allows remote clients to use a binary format for storing cache entries, which is optimal. However, you must make entity classes available to the server so that it can convert between binary format and Java objects.

Additionally, if the cache uses Protobuf (`application/x-protostream`) as the binary format, you must deploy protostream marshallers so that {ProductName} can unmarshall data from your custom code.
