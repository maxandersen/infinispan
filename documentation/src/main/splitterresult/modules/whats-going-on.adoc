= What&#8217;s going on?

The example allows you to start two or more nodes, each of which are started in a separate process.
The node code is very simple, each node starts up, prints the local cache contents, registers a listener that logs
any changes, and starts storing entries of the form `key-<counter> = <local address>-counter`.

.State transfer
[]
{brandname} automatically replicates the cache contents from the existing members to joining members. This can be
controlled in two ways:

* If you don't want the `getCache()` call to block until the entire cache is transferred, you can configure
`clustering.stateTransfer.awaitInitialTransfer = false`.
Note that `cache.get(key)` will still return the correct value, even before the state transfer is finished.
* If it's fast enough to re-create the cache entries from another source, you can disable state transfer completely,
by configuring `clustering.stateTransfer.fetchInMemoryState = false`.
