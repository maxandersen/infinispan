= Detecting Conflicts

Conflicts are detected by retrieving each of the stored values for a given key. The conflict manager retrieves the value stored
from each of the key's write owners defined by the current consistent hash. The .equals method of the stored values is
then used to determine whether all values are equal. If all values are equal then no conflicts exist for the key, otherwise
a conflict has occurred. Note that null values are returned if no entry exists on a given node, therefore we deem a conflict
to have occurred if both a null and non-null value exists for a given key.
