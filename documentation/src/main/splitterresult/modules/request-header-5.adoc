= Request Header

The request header no longer contains `Transaction Type` and `Transaction ID`
elements since they're not in use, and even if they were in use, there are
several operations for which they would not make sense, such as `ping` or
`stats` commands. Once transactions are implemented, the protocol version will
be upped, with the necessary changes in the request header.

The `version` field in the header is updated to `20`.

Two new flags have been added:

* +0x0008+  = operation skips loading from configured cache loader.
* +0x0010+  = operation skips indexing. Only relevant when the query module is enabled for the cache

The following new request operation codes have been added:

* +0x21+ = auth mech list request
* +0x23+ = auth request
* +0x25+ = add client remote event listener request
* +0x27+ = remove client remote event listener request
* +0x29+ = size request
