= A remote query example

In this example, we will show you how to configure the client to utilise the example <<protostream_usage,LibraryInitializerImpl>>,

by registering the required .proto files with the `___protobuf_metadata` cache.

The key part of creating a query is obtaining the _QueryFactory_ for the remote cache using the
_org.infinispan.client.hotrod.Search.getQueryFactory()_ method. Once you have this creating the query is similar to
embedded mode which is covered in link:#query_dsl[this] section.
