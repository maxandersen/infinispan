= Choosing an Editor

You can customise the editor used by git editing `~/.gitconfig`.
The following fires up link:http://code.google.com/p/macvim/[MacVIM] instead of the default vi editor:

.~/.gitconfig
[listing]
----
[core]
     editor = mvim -f
----

Alternatively, you could fire up TextMate or another editors of your choice.
