= Default Local Configuration

{brandname} second-level cache provider comes with a configuration designed for local, single node, environments.
These are the characteristics of such configuration:

Entities, collections, queries and timestamps are stored in non-transactional local caches.

Entities and collections query caches are configured with the following eviction settings:

* Eviction wake up interval is 5 seconds.
* Max number of entries are 10,000.
* Max idle time before expiration is 100 seconds.
* Default eviction algorithm is LRU, least recently used.

You can change these settings on a per entity or collection basis or per individual entity or collection type.
More information in the link:#configuration_properties[Configuration Properties] section below.

_No eviction/expiration is configured for timestamp caches_, nor it's allowed.
