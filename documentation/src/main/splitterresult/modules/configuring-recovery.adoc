= Configuring recovery   

Recovery is _not_ enabled by default in {brandname}.
If disabled, the `TransactionManager` won't be able to work with {brandname} to determine the in-doubt transactions.
The link:#tx_configuration[Transaction configuration] section shows how to enable it.

NOTE: `recovery-cache` attribute is not mandatory and it is configured per-cache.

[NOTE,textlabel="Note",name="note"]
====
For recovery to work, `mode` must be set to `FULL_XA`, since full-blown XA transactions are needed.
