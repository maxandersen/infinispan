= Running tests with JDK 8

While building requires at least JDK 11, the testsuite can be run with JDK 8. In order to do so, you should set the
`JAVA8_HOME` environment variable to point to your JDK 8 installation, e.g.:

....
$ export JAVA8_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
....

And enable the `java8-test` maven profile:

....
$ mvn -Pjava8-test test
....
