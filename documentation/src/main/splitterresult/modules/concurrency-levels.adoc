[id="concurrency-levels_{context}"]
= Concurrency levels

In addition to determining the size of the striped lock container, this concurrency level is also used to tune any JDK `ConcurrentHashMap` based collections where related, such as internal to ``DataContainer``s.
Please refer to the JDK `ConcurrentHashMap` Javadocs for a detailed discussion of concurrency levels, as this parameter is used in exactly the same way in {brandname}.
