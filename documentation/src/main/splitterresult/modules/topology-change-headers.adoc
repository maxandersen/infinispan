= Topology Change Headers

The following section discusses how the response headers look for
topology-aware or hash-distribution-aware clients when there's been a cluster
or view formation change. Note that it's the server that makes the decision on
whether it sends back the new topology based on the current topology id and
the one the client sent. If they're different, it will send back the new topology.
