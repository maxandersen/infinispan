= Shell prompt

You can change your bash shell prompt to print the current repository's branch name.
Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`

.~/.bashrc
[listing]
----
function git_current_branch {
  git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/[\1]/'
}

if [ "$PS1" ]; then
  PS1='[\u@\h:\W]$(git_current_branch)\$ '
fi
----

The resulting shell prompt will look like:

....
trustin@matrix:infinispan-4.2][4.2.x]$
....

If you're a zsh user, you can get even more interesting branch information thanks to link:http://sebastiancelis.com/2009/nov/16/zsh-prompt-git-users/[this blog post] , such as:

* whether your branch is dirty (_X_)
* whether it's ahead of the remote(↑)
* whether it diverges with the remote (↕)
* whether it's behind (↓)

For example, the following prompt indicates that the current branch is 't_ispn775_master' and that it is behind remote:

....
[~/Go/code/infinispan.git]% (t_ispn775_master ↓)
....
