= How come {brandname}'s first release is 4.0.0?  This sounds weird!

We didn't want to release {brandname} as a 1.0, as in all fairness it is not a virgin codebase.
A lot of the code, designs and ideas in {brandname} are from JBoss Cache, and has been tried and tested, proven in high stress environments.
{brandname} should thus be viewed as a mature and stable platform and not a new, experimental one.
