= Overriding the MediaType Programmatically

It's possible to decorate the Cache with a different MediaType, allowing cache operations to be executed sending and receiving different data formats.

Example:

[source,java]
----
link:code_examples/EncodeMediaTypeOverride.java[]
----

Will return the value in JSON format:

[source,json]
----
{
   "_type":"org.infinispan.sample.Person",
   "name":"John",
   "surname":"Doe"
}
----

====
Most Transcoders are installed when server mode is used; when using library mode, an extra dependency, _org.infinispan:infinispan-server-core_ should be added to the project.
