= Single-Node Standalone Spring Application

Using Hibernate within Spring applications is a very common use case.
In this section you will learn what you need to do configure Hibernate within Spring to use {brandname} as second-level cache provider.

As in the previous case, start by making sure that Hibernate {brandname} Cache provider is available in the classpath.
Then, modify `application.properties` file to contain:

....
# Use Infinispan second level cache provider
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.region.factory_class=infinispan
#
# Force using local configuration when only using a single node.
# Otherwise a clustered configuration is loaded.
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.infinispan.cfg=org/infinispan/hibernate/cache/commons/builder/infinispan-configs-local.xml
....

By default when running standalone, the {brandname} second-level cache provider uses an {brandname} configuration thatâ€™s designed for clustered environments.
However, {brandname} also provides a configuration designed for local, single node, environments.
To enable that configuration, set `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.infinispan.cfg` to `org/infinispan/hibernate/cache/commons/builder/infinispan-configs-local.xml` value.
You can find more about the configuration check the link:#default_local_configuration_second_level[Default Local Configuration] section.
