= Storing Protobuf encoded entities

Remote clients that want to be able to index and query their stored entities must do so using the <<protostream,ProtoStream>>
marshaller. This is _key_ for the search capability to work. But it's also possible to store Protobuf entities just for
gaining the benefit of platform independence and not enable indexing if you do not need it.
