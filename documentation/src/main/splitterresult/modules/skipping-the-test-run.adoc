= Skipping the test run

It is sometimes desirable to install the {brandname} package in your local repository without performing a full test run.
To do this, simply use the `skipTests` property:

....
$ mvn -DskipTests install
....

Note that you should _never_ use `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` since modules' test classes depend on other module test classes, and this will cause compilation errors.
