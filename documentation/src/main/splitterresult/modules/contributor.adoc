= Contributor

A contributor will only ever submit patches via GitHub's _pull request_ mechanism.

Contributors should _always_ fork the upstream project on GitHub and work off a clone of this fork.

====
All {brandname} core developers are considered contributors and work off personal forks of the upstream repository.
This allows for complex features to be developed in parallel without tripping up over one another.
This process is certainly not restricted to just {brandname} core developers; any contributor should also participate in this manner.
