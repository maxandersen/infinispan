There is a simple command-line demo of its capabilities distributed with {brandname} under demos/lucene-directory; make sure you grab the "Binaries, server and demos" package from download page, which contains all demos.

Start several instances, then try adding text in one instance and searching for it on the other. The configuration is not tuned at all, but should work out-of-the box without any changes. If your network interface has multicast enabled, it will cluster across the local network with other instances of the demo.
