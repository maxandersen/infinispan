As described in the link:#proto_files[previous section], a fundamental concept of the Protobuf format is the definition
of messages in the .proto schema to determine how an entity is represented. However, in order for our Java
applications to utilise the Protobuf format to transmit/store data, it's necessary for our Java objects to be encoded.
This is handled by the ProtoStream library and its configured _Marshaller_ implementations, which convert plain old
Java objects into the Protobuf format.
