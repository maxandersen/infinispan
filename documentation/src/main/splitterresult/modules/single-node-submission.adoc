= Single Node Submission

Cluster Executor can also run in single node submission mode instead of submitting the command
to all nodes it will instead pick one of the nodes that would have normally received the command
and instead submit it it to only one. Each submission will possibly use a different node to
execute the task on. This can be very useful to use the ClusterExecutor as a
`java.util.concurrent.Executor` which you may have noticed that ClusterExecutor implements.
