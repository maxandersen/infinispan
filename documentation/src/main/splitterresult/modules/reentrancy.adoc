= Reentrancy

When a `ClusteredLock` is configured reentrant, the owner of the lock can reacquire the lock as many consecutive
times as it wants while holding the lock.

Currently, only non reentrant locks are supported. This means that when two consecutive `lock` calls are sent for the same
owner, the first call will acquire the lock if it's available, and the second call will block.
