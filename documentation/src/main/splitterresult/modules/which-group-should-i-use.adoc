= Which group should I use?

The following test groups are used by {brandname}.

[TIP,textlabel="Tip",name="tip"]
====
If your test does not fit into one of these groups, a new group should be added.
====

[table,tablepcwidth="100",rowcount="7",header-option="",colcount="2"]
|===
| _unit_ | Unit tests using stubs to isolate and test each major class in {brandname}. This is the default group run if no test group is specified
| _functional_ | Tests which test the general functionality of {brandname}
| _jgroups_ | Tests which need to send data on a JGroups Channel
| _transaction_ | Tests which use a transaction manager
| _profiling_ | Tests used for manual profiling, not meant for automated test runs
| _manual_ | Other tests that are run manually
|===

Every test (except those not intended to be run by continuous integration) should at least be in the *functional* or *unit* groups, since these are the default test groups executed by Maven, and are run when preparing a release.
