= Synchronicity of events

By default, all async notifications are dispatched in the notification thread pool.
Sync notifications will delay the operation from continuing until the listener method completes or the CompletionStage
completes (the former causing the thread to block). Alternatively, you could annotate your listener as _asynchronous_ in
which case the operation will continue immediately, while the notification is completed asynchronously on the notification thread pool.
To do this, simply annotate your listener such:
