= Batching and JTA

Behind the scenes, the batching functionality starts a JTA transaction, and all the invocations in that scope are associated with it.
For this it uses a very simple (e.g. no recovery) internal `TransactionManager` implementation.
With batching, you get:

[arabic]
. Locks you acquire during an invocation are held until the batch completes
. Changes are all replicated around the cluster in a batch as part of the batch completion process. Reduces replication chatter for each update in the batch.
. If synchronous replication or invalidation are used, a failure in replication/invalidation will cause the batch to roll back.
. All the transaction related configurations apply for batching as well.
