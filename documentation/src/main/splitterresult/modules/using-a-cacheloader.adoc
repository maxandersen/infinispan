= Using a CacheLoader

Using a CacheLoader you can have the index content backed up to a permanent storage; you can use a shared store for all nodes or one per node, see cache passivation for more details.

When using a CacheLoader to store a Lucene index, to get best write performance you would need to configure the CacheLoader with _async=true_ .
