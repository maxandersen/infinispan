= Handling broken link between sites

A System Administrator action is needed if the link between the producer and consumer site is broken during the
cross-site state transfer (data consistency is not ensured in consumer site). The producer site retries for a while
before giving up. Then, it gets back to normal state. However, the consumer site is not able to get back to normal state
and, here, an action from System Administrator is need. The System Administrator should use the operation
+cancelReceiveState(String siteName)+ to bring the consumer site to normal state.
