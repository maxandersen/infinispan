= Integration with the transaction manager

Even though this is transaction manager specific, generally a transaction manager would need a reference to a `XAResource` implementation in order to invoke `XAResource.recover()` on it.
In order to obtain a reference to an {brandname} `XAResource` following API can be used:

[source,java]
----
XAResource xar = cache.getAdvancedCache().getXAResource();
----

It is a common practice to run the recovery in a different process from the one running the transaction.
