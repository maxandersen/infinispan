= What do I need - pessimistic or optimistic transactions?

From a use case perspective, optimistic transactions should be used when there is _not_ a lot of contention between multiple transactions running at the same time.
That is because the optimistic transactions rollback if data has changed between the time it was read and the time it was committed (with write skew check enabled).

On the other hand, pessimistic transactions might be a better fit when there is high contention on the keys and transaction rollbacks are less desirable.
Pessimistic transactions are more costly by their nature: each write operation potentially involves a RPC for lock acquisition.
