= If you have cloned upstream

If you have a clone of the upstream, you may want to update it from time to time. Running:

....
$ git fetch origin
$ git fetch origin --tags
....

will often do the trick. You could then pull the specific branches you would need to update:

....
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
$ git checkout 4.2.x
$ git pull origin 4.2.x
....
