= Comments

It is _extremely important_ that comments for each commit are clear and follow certain conventions.
This allows for proper parsing of logs by git tools.
Read link:http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[this article] on how to format comments for git and adhere to them.
Further to the recommendations in the article, the short summary of the commit message should be in the following format:

....
ISPN-XXX Subject line of the JIRA in question
....

This can optionally be followed by a detailed explanation of the commit.
Why it was done, how much of it was completed, etc.
You may wish to express this as a list, for example:

* Add a unit test
* Add more unit tests
* Fix regressions
* Solve major NP-Complete problems

Make sure however to split separate concerns - especially if they are unrelated - in separate commits.
