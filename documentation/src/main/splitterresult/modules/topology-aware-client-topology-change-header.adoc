| Topology Id | vInt | Topology ID

This could be a subset of the entire cluster if only a fraction of those
nodes are running Hot Rod servers.
| m1: Host/IP length | vInt | Length of hostname or IP address of individual cluster member that Hot Rod
client can use to access it. Using variable length here allows for covering
for hostnames, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
| m1: Host/IP address | string | String containing hostname or IP address of individual cluster member
that Hot Rod client can use to access it.
| m1: Port | 2 bytes (Unsigned Short) | Port that Hot Rod clients can use to communicate with this cluster member.
| m2: Host/IP length | vInt | 
| m2: Host/IP address | string |
