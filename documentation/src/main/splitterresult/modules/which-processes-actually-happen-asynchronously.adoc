= Which processes actually happen asynchronously?

There are 4 things in {brandname} that can be considered to be on the critical path of a typical write operation.
These are, in order of cost:

* network calls
* marshalling
* writing to a cache store (optional)
* locking

As of {brandname} 4.0, using the async methods will take the network calls and marshalling off the critical path.  For various technical reasons, writing to a cache store and acquiring locks, however, still happens in the caller's thread.  In future, we plan to take these offline as well.  See link:http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/infinispan-dev/2010-January/002219.html[this developer mail list thread] about this topic.
