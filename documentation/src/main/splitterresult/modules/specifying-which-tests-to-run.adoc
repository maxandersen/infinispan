= Specifying which tests to run

A single test can be executed using the test property.
The value is the short name (not the fully qualified package name) of the test. For example:

....
$ mvn -Dtest=FqnTest test
....

Alternatively, if there is more than one test with a given classname in your test suite, you could provide the path to the test.

....
$ mvn -Dtest=org/infinispan/api/MixedModeTest test
....

Patterns are also supported:

....
$ mvn -Dtest=org/infinispan/api/* test
....

Also, you can always pass your own Log4j configuration file via `-Dlog4.configuration` with your own logging settings.
