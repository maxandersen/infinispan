= Release branches

{brandname} has several main release branches. These are master (ongoing work on the current unstable release),
and maintenance branches for previous minor releases (e.g., `5.0.x`, `4.2.x`, `4.1.x`).
Work should never be committed directly to any of these release branches directly; topic branches should always be used for work, and these topic branches should be merged in using the process outlined above.
