= Running permutations manually or in an IDE

Sometimes you want to run a test using settings other than the defaults (such as UDP for `jgroups` group tests or the EmbeddedTransactionManager for `transaction` group tests).
This can be achieved by referring to the Maven POM file to figure out which system properties are passed in to the test when doing something different.
For example to run a `jgroups` group test in your IDE using TCP instead of the default UDP, set `-Dinfinispan.cluster.stack=tcp`.
Or, to use JBoss JTA (Arjuna TM) instead of the EmbeddedTransactionManager in a `transaction` group test, set `-Dinfinispan.test.jta.tm=jbosstm`.
Please refer to the POM file for more properties and permutations.
