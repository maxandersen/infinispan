= Write-Only Entry View

The function parameters for write-only maps provide the user with a
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/EntryView.WriteEntryView.html[write-only entry view]
to modify the data in the cache, which include these
operations:

* link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/EntryView.WriteEntryView.html#set-V-org.infinispan.commons.api.functional.MetaParam.Writable...-[`set(V, MetaParam.Writable...)`]
method allows for a new value to be
associated with the cache entry for which this function is executed, and it
optionally takes zero or more metadata parameters to be stored along with
the value. See link:#meta_parameter[Metadata Parameter Handling] for more information.
* link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/EntryView.WriteEntryView.html#remove--[`remove()`]
method removes the cache entry, including both value and metadata
parameters associated with this key.
