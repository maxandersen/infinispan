= How does it work?

By default, the segment of a key is computed using the key's `hashCode()`.
If you use the grouping API, {brandname} will compute the segment of the group and use
that as the segment of the key.
See the link:#key_ownership[Key Ownership] section for more details on how segments are
then mapped to nodes.

When the group API is in use, it is important that every node can still compute the
owners of every key without contacting other nodes.
For this reason, the group cannot be specified manually.
The group can either be intrinsic to the entry (generated by the key class) or extrinsic
(generated by an external function).
