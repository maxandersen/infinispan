= As a local cache

The primary use for {brandname} is to provide a fast in-memory cache of frequently accessed data. Suppose you have a slow
data source (database, web service, text file, etc): you could load some or all of that data in memory so that it's just a
memory access away from your code. Using {brandname} is better than using a simple ConcurrentHashMap, since it has additional
useful features such as expiration and eviction.
