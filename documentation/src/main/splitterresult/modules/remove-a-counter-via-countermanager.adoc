= Remove a counter via CounterManager

use with caution.

There is a difference between remove a counter via the `Strong/WeakCounter` interfaces and the `CounterManager`.
The `CounterManager.remove(String)` removes the counter value from the cluster and removes all the listeners registered
in the counter in the local counter instance.
In addition, the counter instance is no longer reusable and it may return an invalid results.

On the other side, the `Strong/WeakCounter` removal only removes the counter value.
The instance can still be reused and the listeners still works.

The counter is re-created if it is accessed after a removal.
