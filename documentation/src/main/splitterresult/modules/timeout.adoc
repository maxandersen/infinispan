[id="timeout_{context}"]
= Timeout

Cluster Executor allows for a timeout to be set per invocation. This defaults to the distributed sync timeout
as configured on the Transport Configuration. This timeout works in both a clustered and non clustered
cache manager. The executor may or may not interrupt the threads executing a task when the timeout expires. However
when the timeout occurs any `Consumer` or `Future` will be completed passing back a `TimeoutException`.
This value can be overridden by ivoking the
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/ClusterExecutor.html#timeout-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-[timeout]
method and supplying the desired duration.
