= TransactionManagerLookup Interface

`TransactionManagerLookup` provides an entry point to fetch a {tm}.

Available implementations of `TransactionManagerLookup`:

{gtml}:: A lookup class that locates {tm}s running in Java EE application servers. Defaults to the {rtm} if it cannot find a {tm}.

====
In most cases, {gtml} is suitable. However, you can implement the `TransactionManagerLookup` interface if you need to integrate a custom {tm}.
====

{rtml}:: A basic, and volatile, {tm} if no other implementation is available. Note that this implementation has significant limitations when handling concurrent transactions and recovery.
