A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of a decentralized distributed system
that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table; +(key, value)+ pairs
are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the
value associated with a given key. Responsibility for maintaining the mapping
from keys to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change
in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption. This allows a
DHT to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node
arrivals, departures, and failures.
