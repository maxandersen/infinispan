:context: split

In a split brain situation, each network partition will install its own
JGroups view, removing the nodes from the other partition(s).
We don't have a direct way of determining whether the has been split into
two or more partitions, since the partitions are unaware of each other.
Instead, we assume the cluster has split when one or more nodes
disappear from the JGroups cluster without sending an explicit leave message.
