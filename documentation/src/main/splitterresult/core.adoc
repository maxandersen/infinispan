The `infinispan-core` module contains the actual implementation used for local/embedded mode.
When adding new functionality to the APIs, it is generally safe to start by putting them in `infinispan-core` and promoting them to `infinispan-api` only when it is deemed mature enough to do so and it makes sense across the various use-cases.
