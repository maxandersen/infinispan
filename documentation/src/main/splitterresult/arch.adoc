Internally, each and every cache operation is encapsulated by a command.  These
command objects represent the type of operation being performed, and also hold
references to necessary parameters.  The actual logic of a given command, for
example a ReplaceCommand, is encapsulated in the commandâ€™s perform() method.
Very object-oriented and easy to test.

All of these commands implement the VisitableCommand interface which allow a
Visitor (described in next section) to process them accordingly.
