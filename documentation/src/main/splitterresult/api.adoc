The `infinispan-api` module should only contain the public interfaces which can be used in any context (local, remote, etc).
Any additions and/or modifications to this module _must_ be discussed and approved by the core team beforehand.
Ideally it should not contain any concrete classes: rare exceptions may be made for small, self-contained classes which need to be referenced from the API interfaces and for which the introduction of an interface would be deemed cumbersome.
