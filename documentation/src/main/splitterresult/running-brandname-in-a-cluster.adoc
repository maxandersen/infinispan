It is easy set up a clustered cache. This tutorial will show you how to create two nodes in different processes on the
same local machine.
The quickstart follows the same structure as the embedded-cache quickstart, using Maven to compile the project, and a
main method to launch the node.

If you are following along with the quickstarts, you can try the examples out.

The quickstart defines two clustered caches, one in _replication mode_ and one _distribution mode_.
