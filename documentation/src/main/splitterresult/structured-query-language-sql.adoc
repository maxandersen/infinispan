SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held
in a relational database management system (RDBMS).  Originally based upon
relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data
definition language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes
data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and
data access control.
