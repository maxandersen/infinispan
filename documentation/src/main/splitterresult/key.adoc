:context: key

In a distributed cache, a key is allocated to a list of nodes with an opaque algorithm.
There is no easy way to reverse the computation and generate a key that maps to a
particular node.
However, we can generate a sequence of (pseudo-)random keys, see what their primary
owner is, and hand them out to the application when it needs a key mapping to a
particular node.
