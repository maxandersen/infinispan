= Livelock
:context: livelock

A livelock is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes
involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none
progressing.

A real-world example of livelock occurs when two people meet in a narrow
corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the other pass,
but they end up swaying from side to side without making any progress because
they both repeatedly move the same way at the same time.
