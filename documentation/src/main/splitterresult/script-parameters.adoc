Aside from the standard bindings described above, when a script is executed it can be passed a set of named parameters which also appear as bindings.
Parameters are passed as +name,value+ pairs where +name+ is a string and +value+ can be any value that is understood by the marshaller in use.

The following is an example of a JavaScript script which takes two parameters, +multiplicand+ and +multiplier+ and multiplies them.
Because the last operation is an expression evaluation, its result is returned to the invoker.

[source,javascript]
----
// mode=local,language=javascript
multiplicand * multiplier
----

To store the script in the script cache, use the following Hot Rod code:

[source,java]
----
RemoteCache<String, String> scriptCache = cacheManager.getCache("___script_cache");
scriptCache.put("multiplication.js",
  "// mode=local,language=javascript\n" +
  "multiplicand * multiplier\n");
