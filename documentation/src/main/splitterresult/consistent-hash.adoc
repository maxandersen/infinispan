:context: consistent-hash

A technique of mapping keys to servers such that, given a stable cluster
topology, any server in the cluster can locate where a given key is mapped
to with minimal computational complexity.

Consistent hashing is a purely algorithmic technique, and doesn't rely on
any metadata or any network broadcasts to "search" for a key in a cluster.
This makes it extremely efficient to use.
