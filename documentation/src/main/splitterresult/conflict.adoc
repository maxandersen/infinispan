= Usage
:context: conflict

During a partition merge the ConflictManager automatically attempts to resolve conflicts utilising the configured
EntryMergePolicy, however it is also possible to manually search for/resolve conflicts as required by your application.

The code below shows how to retrieve an EmbeddedCacheManager's ConflictManager, how to retrieve all versions of a given
key and how to check for conflicts across a given cache.

====
Although the `ConflictManager::getConflicts` stream is processed per entry, the underlying spliterator is in
fact lazily-loading cache entries on a per segment basis.
