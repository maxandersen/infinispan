In replicated mode, {brandname} will store every entry on every node in the grid. This offers high durability and
availability of data, but means the storage capacity is limited by the available heap space on the node with least
memory.
The cache should be configured to work in replication mode (either synchronous or asynchronous), and can otherwise be
configured as normal. For example, if you want to configure the cache programmatically:

[source,java]

You can configure an identical cache using XML:

.infinispan-replication.xml
[source,xml,subs="attributes+",nowrap-option=""]
----
link:config_examples/config_cache_replicated.xml[]
----

along with

[source,java]
