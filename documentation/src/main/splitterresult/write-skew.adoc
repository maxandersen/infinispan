= Write skew
:context: write-skew

In a write skew anomaly, two transactions (T1 and T2) concurrently read an
overlapping data set (e.g. values V1 and V2), concurrently make disjoint
updates (e.g. T1 updates V1, T2 updates V2), and finally concurrently commit,
neither having seen the update performed by the other. Were the system
serializable, such an anomaly would be impossible, as either T1 or T2 would
have to occur "first", and be visible to the other. In contrast, snapshot
isolation such as +REPEATABLE_READ+ and +READ_COMMITTED+ permits write skew
anomalies.

{brandname} can detect write skews and can be configured to roll back
transactions when write skews are detected.
