Caches are created by using a CacheContainer instance - either the
EmbeddedCacheManager or a RemoteCacheManager.  In addition to their capabilities
as a factory for Caches, CacheContainers also act as a registry for looking
up Caches.

EmbeddedCacheManagers create either clustered or standalone Caches that reside
in the same JVM.  RemoteCacheManagers, on the other hand, create RemoteCaches
that connect to a remote cache tier via the Hot Rod protocol.
