{brandname} uses the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R_style[K&amp;R code style] for all Java source files, with two exceptions:

[arabic]
. use 3 spaces instead of a tab character for indentations.
. braces start on the same line for class, interface and method declarations as well as code blocks.

In addition, sure all link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline[new line characters] used must be LF (UNIX style line feeds). Most good IDEs allow you to set this, regardless of operating system used.

All patches or code committed must adhere to this style. Code style settings which can be imported into IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse are committed in the project sources, in link:https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/ide-settings/[ide-settings] .
