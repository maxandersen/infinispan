An _Externalizer_ is a class that knows how to marshall a given object type to
a byte array, and how to unmarshall the contents of a byte array into an
instance of the object type. Externalizers are effectively an {brandname}
extension that allows users to specify how their types are serialized. The
underlying {brandname} marshalling infrastructure builds on
link:http://www.jboss.org/jbossmarshalling[JBoss Marshalling] , and offers
efficient payloads and stream caching. This provides much better performance
than standard Java serialization.
