[]
This method provides you access to the underlying Transport that is used to send
messages to other nodes.  In most cases a user wouldn't ever need to go to
this level, but if you want to get Transport specific information (in this
case JGroups) you can use this mechanism.

.<a href="{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getStats--">getStats()</a>
[]
The stats provided here are coalesced from all of the active caches in this manager.
These stats can be useful to see if there is something wrong going on with your
cluster overall.
