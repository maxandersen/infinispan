The link:{jdkdocroot}/java/util/stream/Stream.html[Stream]
has a terminal operation called
link:{jdkdocroot}/java/util/stream/Stream.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-[forEach]
which allows for running some sort of side effect operation on the data.  In this case it may be desirable to get a reference to
the `Cache` that is backing this Stream.  If your `Consumer` implements the
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/stream/CacheAware.html[CacheAware]
interface the `injectCache` method be invoked before the accept method from the `Consumer` interface.
