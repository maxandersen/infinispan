The availability mode of a cache is exposed in JMX as an attribute in the
link:{javadocroot}/jmxComponents.html#Cache[Cache MBean].
The attribute is writable, allowing an administrator to forcefully migrate
a cache from DEGRADED mode back to AVAILABLE (at the cost of
consistency).

The availability mode is also accessible via the
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html[AdvancedCache]
interface:
