Memcached is an in-memory caching system, often used to speed-up
database-driven websites. Memcached also defines a text based,
client/server, caching protocol, known as the Memcached protocol
{brandname} offers a server which speaks the Memcached protocol, allowing
Memcached itself to be replaced by {brandname}. Thanks to {brandname}'s
clustering capabilities, it can offer data failover capabilities not present
in original Memcached systems.
